Welcome to my repository explaining how to use your Terminal :tada:

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately, because I only have experience with Unix (Linux and MacOS) Terminal, I am unable to make a guide a guide on Windows Powershell :sob:

If you are using Windows, consider downloading [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows where you can apply most of the things I wrote in this repository.
